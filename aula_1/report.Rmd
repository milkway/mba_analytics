## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
set.seed(123)

N = 200
base <- tibble(E = 1:N, 
               x = runif(N, min = -1, max = 1),
               y = runif(N, min = -1, max = 1),
               flag = if_else(x^2 + y^2 <= 1, "dentro", "fora"))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
base <- base %>% 
  mutate(cumsum = cumsum(flag == "dentro"),
         freq_rel = cumsum/E)
```

O meu `valor` Ã© `r base$freq_rel[N]`
